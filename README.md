# AP_GP-Checker
An assembly program based on MIPS architecture and uses the Qtspim simulator. 
Its a program to check if the input numbers forms arithmetic, geometric progression or not. 
I found a way to write an assembly program in the easiest by making use of the MIPS architecture which kinda easy to understand and uses a specified simulator to run it.
